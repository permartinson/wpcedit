It is up to you to determine if this software can be used without violating any agreements that prohibits you from using this software. For example there may have been an agreement you agreed to when you obtained the ROM image. Additionally, you may be bound to an implicit agreement if your pinball machine came with a manual. The back cover of the manual may contain verbage that may make the use of this software a violation of the agreement.</p>\n            <p class=\"body-sm\">By clicking the 'I understand and agree' button below, you acknowledge that you have read the text in this dialog box and accept responsibility for using this software in an appropriate manner. You also recognize that modifying the contents of the ROM image can be potentially catastrophic to your pinball machine. For example if you change a byte from a value of 5 to 200 and this byte in the ROM happened to be the number of milliseconds to energize a flasher, then this example ROM modification would cause the flasher bulb to burn out when the game tries to energize the flasher.</p>\n            <p class=\"body-sm\">Please do not distribute modified ROM images that may have been generated by this software or from any other source.
