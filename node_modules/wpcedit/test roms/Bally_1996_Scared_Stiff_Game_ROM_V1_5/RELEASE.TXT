	Changes from 1.4:

	Rev 1.5 fixes many bugs:

	1) Improved Coffin Multiball display effect.
	2) Eliminated the very rare problem at ball start that could cause
	   the game to reset.
	3) Deadheads were always awarding the base value. Now the displayed
	   value is awarded correctly.
	4) Fixed a bug in the skill-shot that caused players 2, 3 and 4 to
	   have no points awarded if they made the skill shot at the start
	   of the ball.
	5) Coffin jam compensation code improved.
	6) Changed the Attract Mode Spider adjustment so that it sets
	   the number of minutes between spins (or OFF). Factory Setting
	   is for 5 minutes between spins. This is to help the spiders
	   last longer, yet still catch the attention of people passing
	   the game on location.
	7) Fixed bad switch logic on Leaper targets. A target that stuck
	   close would keep scoring.
	8) Fixed broken spider logic to allow players to complete the 
	   spider.
	9) Fixed lamps for a broken spider spin.  Sometimes right skull
	   lamp would stay off.
