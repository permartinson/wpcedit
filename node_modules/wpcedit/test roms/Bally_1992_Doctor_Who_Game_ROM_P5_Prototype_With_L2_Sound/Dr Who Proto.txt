This is my first post to the IPDB..... about time I gave something back.

I picked up a PROTOTYPE Dr Who with the moving head and found inside software revisions I have not seen on any site before.  The CPU is P5 and sound is L2.

The attract mode is slightly different.  All Dr Who software will run the dalek head - but I do not know anything else about this software revision.

The strange thing is the sound is L2, Williams only give a L1 on there site.   BUT - the L2 is dated prior to the L1.... 

The CPU is revision P5

Checksums:
CPU_u6      8ED5
SOUND_U14   E088
SOUND_U15   D488
SOUND_U18   9028
